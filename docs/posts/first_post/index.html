<p>Since this is the first post on this blog, I figured it might be a good idea to outline the current projects that I&rsquo;m working on.</p>
<h2 id="unnanounced-unity-ecs-project">Unnanounced Unity ECS project</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m co-developing this project with my brother and it aims to fuse together card-playing and dungeon-crawling mechanics to create a unique player experience. We&rsquo;re developing it on the Unity platform and making use of their new-ish Entiy Component System (ECS) for all-around performance improvements and a novel coding experience.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re quickly approaching a completed prototype for the project, with the current major hurdle being the integration of multiplayer into the game via Unity&rsquo;s Netcode for Entities.</p>
<h2 id="rust-delvings">Rust delvings</h2>
<p>While not technically a project, I&rsquo;ve been having fun diving into the world of rust this past week. I was motivated to check it out after coming across a new ECS-only game engine called Bevy  that&rsquo;s being developed with the language.</p>
<p>So far, it&rsquo;s been an absolute blast diving into learning the language and wrapping my head around the borrow checker, algebraic types, and just the general language syntax.</p>
<p>Looking forward to reporting more on my learning progress in future posts. One possible trajectory might see me contributing to one of the many plugins for the bevy engine.</p>
<h2 id="c-refresher--new-learnings">C# refresher + new learnings</h2>
<p>Again, not technically a project, but I&rsquo;m also actively updating my C# knowledge after being away from the language for quite some time. The unity project mentioned above is coded in C# and so I&rsquo;m getting back into the language in a big way with my work on that game. With that said, I&rsquo;m also looking to learn more about LINQ, asynchronous programming, and some of the more powerful libraries in the C# ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="moonsneeze-the-wind-breathes-first">Moonsneeze: The Wind Breathes First</h2>
<p>An ongoing novel project that I&rsquo;ve been working on for the past year that straddles the line between cozy fantasy and some of the more unsavory conventions often found in the grimdark genre.</p>
<p>The work has currently gone through a round of beta readers and has been read by a professional editor. I&rsquo;ve been spending the last few months humming and hawing about what changes I want to make to the novel (if any), but I&rsquo;m currently leaning towards doing some major revisions to the main character&rsquo;s story arc, but we will see!</p>
<p><a href="https://moonsneeze.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Cover_sample.jpg">Take a peek at the cover</a></p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>Very excited to share further updates on the projects listed above. Once the Unity game project is further along, I&rsquo;m looking forward revealing some of the game&rsquo;s features and some of the great art that has already been created for it.</p>
<p>I also hope to document some of my rust and C# learnings throughfuture posts here. More to come!</p>
