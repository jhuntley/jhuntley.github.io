<p>Thanks to a <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/game-of-life">fantastic tutorial</a> and the help of a <a href="https://github.com/shaunluttin">friend</a> I was able dive into creating Conway&rsquo;s Game of Life for the first time. I&rsquo;m just beginning my journey into rust and I think this was a great first project to see the language in action while also learning about WebAssembly.</p>
<p>The most challenging part of the implementation was getting the WebAssembly to load within the Hugo framework. We ended up creating a folder within the posts directory and then using a custom shortcode to load in the JavaScript (the semi-necessary frontend for Rust when playing with WebAssembly, as I understand it).</p>
