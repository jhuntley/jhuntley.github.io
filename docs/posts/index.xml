      <description>Making Game of Life with Rust and WebAssembly Thanks to a fantastic tutorial and the help of a friend I was able dive into creating Conway&amp;rsquo;s Game of Life for the first time. I&amp;rsquo;m just beginning my journey into Rust and I think this was a great first project to see the language in action while also learning about WebAssembly.&#xA;The most challenging part of the implementation was getting the WebAssembly to load within the Hugo framework.</description>

      <description>Current Projects Since this is the first post on this blog, I figured it might be a good idea to outline the current projects that I&amp;rsquo;m working on.&#xA;Unnanounced Unity ECS project I&amp;rsquo;m co-developing this project with my brother and it aims to fuse together card-playing and dungeon-crawling mechanics to create a unique player experience. We&amp;rsquo;re developing it on the Unity platform and making use of their new-ish Entiy Component System (ECS) for all-around performance improvements and a novel coding experience.</description>
