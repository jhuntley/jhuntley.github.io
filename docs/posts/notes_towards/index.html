			<p>An idea just came to me for a novel that would take contet from fantasy genre novels and mix them with elements from long-form poetry (/wave <em>Beowulf</em>).</p>
<p>Spectral Snoo opens the latch to the roar of life
candle flames, like stretched stars, wave and flicker atop tables half-laked with stale ale.</p>
<pre><code>It's from this doorway that Spectral Snoo (lover of unchivalric acts, belicose fartmaker) observes himself
becoming numb.
    *The bastards have my table*. Squat they are Tiny Rufus and Gurgles exhanging cards as if they were tokens of affection.
</code></pre>
<p>Perhaps the most basic difference between the lines above and a traditional fantasy novel are simply a sense of play the notion of what consitutes a paragraph. The poetic line is introduced into the novel form in order to arrive at a more free-form and flying style of composition.</p>
