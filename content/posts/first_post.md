# Current Projects

Since this is the first post on this blog, I figured it might be a good idea to outline the current projects that I'm working on.

## Unnanounced Unity ECS project

I'm co-developing this project with my brother and it aims to fuse together card-playing and dungeon-crawling mechanics to create a unique player experience. We're developing it on the Unity platform and making use of their new-ish Entiy Component System (ECS) for all-around performance improvements and a novel coding experience.

We're quickly approaching a completed prototype for the project, with the current major hurdle being the integration of multiplayer into the game via Unity's Netcode for Entities.

## Rust delvings

While not technically a project, I've been having fun diving into the world of rust this past week. I was motivated to check it out after coming across a new ECS-only game engine called Bevy  that's being developed with the language.

So far, it's been an absolute blast diving into learning the language and wrapping my head around the borrow checker, algebraic types, and just the general language syntax.

Looking forward to reporting more on my learning progress in future posts. One possible trajectory might see me contributing to one of the many plugins for the bevy engine.

## C# refresher + new learnings

Again, not technically a project, but I'm also actively updating my C# knowledge after being away from the language for quite some time. The unity project mentioned above is coded in C# and so I'm getting back into the language in a big way with my work on that game. With that said, I'm also looking to learn more about LINQ, asynchronous programming, and some of the more powerful libraries in the C# ecosystem.

## Moonsneeze: The Wind Breathes First

An ongoing novel project that I've been working on for the past year that straddles the line between cozy fantasy and some of the more unsavory conventions often found in the grimdark genre. 

The work has currently gone through a round of beta readers and has been read by a professional editor. I've been spending the last few months humming and hawing about what changes I want to make to the novel (if any), but I'm currently leaning towards doing some major revisions to the main character's story arc, but we will see!

## Closing thoughts

Very excited to share further updates on the projects listed above. Once the Unity game project is further along, I'm looking forward revealing some of the game's features and some of the great art that has already been created for it.

I also hope to document some of my rust and C# learnings throughfuture posts here. More to come!
